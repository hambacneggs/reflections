When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When working with a team, or if I want to share my work publicly and let
  others use it.Also, I could use it as a central server to store my code, so I
  could access it from
  anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You may not want to stay in sync all the time automatically. What if you were
  working with someone else and they were making conflicting changes while you
  were working on your local repository. I think it's best to work on merging
  changes when you are ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

  Forks are clones that are done only on GitHubs servers. This would be done
  when you want to work on a repository but you don't have the permission to
  edit it directly.

  Clones are copies of a repository created on a local repository.

  Branches are copies done within a repository.
