When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When working with a team, or if I want to share my work publicly and let
  others use it.Also, I could use it as a central server to store my code, so I
  could access it from
  anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You may not want to stay in sync all the time automatically. What if you were
  working with someone else and they were making conflicting changes while you
  were working on your local repository. I think it's best to work on merging
  changes when you are ready.
